# Terraform_Assginment

<ol><li>Write Terraform script to create a custom VPC and deploy two EC2 VMs on AWS using Terraform.</li>

<li>The code should be broken into three different parts:</li>

<ul><li>Networking (define the VPC and all of its components)</li>

<li>SSH-Key (dynamically create an SSH-key pair for connecting to VMs)</li>

<li>EC2 (deploy a VM in the public subnet, and deploy another VM in a private subnet)</li></ul>

<li>NGINX should be accessed for all the internet</li>

<li>Automate Terraform Deployment with Jenkins Pipelines</li></ol>
